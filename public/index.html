				<i>A digital calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always
					handheld, designed to
					calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics. They have completely replaced slide
					rules
					in traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings.In
					certain
					contexts such as higher education, scientific calculators have been superseded by graphing
					calculators,
					which offer a superset of digital calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input
					data
					and write and store programs for the device.

			<div id="em-text"><em>The first scientific calculator that included all of the basic ideas above was the
					programmable
					Hewlett-Packard HP-9100A, released in 1968, though the Wang LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron
					had
					some features later identified with scientific calculator designs. The HP-9100 series was built
					entirely
					from discrete transistor logic with no integrated circuits, and was one of the first uses of the
					CORDIC
					algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device, as well as the first
					calculator
					based on reverse Polish notation (RPN) entry. HP became closely identified with RPN calculators from
					then on, and even today some of their high-end calculators (particularly the long-lived HP-12C
					financial
					calculator and the HP-48 series of graphing calculators) still offer RPN as their default input mode
					due
					to having garnered a very large following.
